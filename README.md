# Zeplin Connected Components Documentation üß©

Connected Components in Zeplin enables developers to access components in their codebase right on the designs‚Äîwith links to Storybook, GitHub and any other source of documentation based on your workflow.

After connecting your components in Zeplin to your components in code, you'll be able to get a high level overview of the component right on the designs, like so:
